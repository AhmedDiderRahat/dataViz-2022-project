### Introduction
Data visualization is the process to develop an understanding of row data. By using this, we can get insights that are not visible in the first place. It is one of the core processes of generating information from data. In our project, we visualize the Airbnb data for New York City. We try to make some graphical representations of the features and also demonstrate the relationship between features.

Airbnb stands for Air Bed and Breakfast. According to business model navigator “Aribnb is an American company that operates an online marketplace and hospitality service for people to lease or rent short-term lodging including holiday cottages, apartments, homestays, hostel beds, or hotel rooms, to participate in or facilitate experiences related to tourism such as walking tours, and to make reservations at restaurants. The company does not own any real estate or conduct tours; it is a broker which receives percentage service fees in conjunction with every booking. Like all hospitality services, Airbnb is an example of collaborative consumption and sharing. The company has over 4 million lodging listings in 65,000 cities and 191 countries and has facilitated over 260 million check-ins.”


### Goal of the Projects: 
	1. Analyze the features of the NYC Airbnb dataset from Kaggle. 
	2. Explain and visualize univariate and bivariate features.
	3. Generate the insight from the dataset.



### The data set
The data set is collected from kaggle.com. According to Kaggle, “Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019. This data file includes all needed information to find out more about hosts, geographical availability, and necessary metrics to make predictions and draw conclusions”.
Features of the Dataset:

 	1. id: The id assigned to each airbnb to identify them uniquely.
	2. name: The name assigned to each airbnb.
	3. host_id: The id assigned to each host to identify them uniquely.
